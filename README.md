All programming codes and mathematical models accompanying a paper M. Kapelko "Evaluating input- and output-specific inefficiency in courts of justice. An empirical study of Polish district courts", forthcoming in International Transactions in Operational Research. They include codes for models for the computation of input-output-specific inefficiency: GAMS code for the main model, GAMS code for the additional model A, and R code for additional model B. The mathematical models are also included. The codes and mathematical models were created as a result of the project funded by the National Science Centre in Poland (grant no. 2023/49/B/HS4/02991).
